### 1Ô∏è‚É£ UFW Not Found Initially

Tried checking UFW status, but got a "command not found" error.

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install UFW

Installed UFW using the APT package manager.

```
sudo apt install ufw
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Enable UFW

Enabled the firewall so it becomes active and starts on boot.

```
sudo ufw enable
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Check Firewall Status

Verified whether UFW was active after enabling it.

```
sudo ufw status
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Add Firewall Rules

Blocked **Telnet (port 23)** and allowed **SSH (port 22)** using UFW rules.

```
sudo ufw deny 23 sudo ufw allow 22
```

6Ô∏è‚É£ List Active Rules with Numbers

Displayed all current firewall rules with indexes using:

```
sudo ufw status numbered
```

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Test Telnet Access on Blocked Port

Tested connection to port 23 using Telnet. Connection was refused, confirming the rule worked.

```
telnet localhost 23
```

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Delete Firewall Rules (Cleanup)

Removed the rules added earlier for port 23 and 22.

```
sudo ufw delete deny 23 sudo ufw delete allow 22
```

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Disable UFW

Disabled UFW and stopped it from starting on boot.
